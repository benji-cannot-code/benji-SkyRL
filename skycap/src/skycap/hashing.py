"""Identity hashes for the context graph.

A trajectory's graph dedupes by content, so what counts as "the same message"
is decided here, once. Hashes are taken over canonical JSON: sorted keys, and
top-level keys whose value is ``None``, ``[]`` or ``{}`` dropped, because
clients disagree about spelling "absent". An SDK replaying an assistant
message may drop ``"refusal": null`` or ``"annotations": []`` that the server
sent; those are the same message, and hashing them apart would fork the graph
on every turn. Token mode goes further and hashes only the fields a renderer
reads (``token_match_hash``).

Nothing is canonicalized across providers: one trajectory speaks one dialect.
